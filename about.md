**Current Position** | I am a research assistant in the [Complex Human Data Hub](https://psychologicalsciences.unimelb.edu.au/research/hubs/chdh), computationally modelling human visual cognition and illusion from Bayesian perspective under the supervision of [Prof. Charles Kemp](http://www.charleskemp.com/).

**Background** | I am an undergraduate at the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/), ranked top 3% academically among over 10,000 students in the faculty of science. I acquired knowledge of statistics and psychology from [Bachelor of Science](https://study.unimelb.edu.au/find/courses/undergraduate/bachelor-of-science/), skills of computer science from [Diploma in computing](https://study.unimelb.edu.au/find/courses/undergraduate/diploma-in-computing/), and sense of composition and orchestration from [Diploma in Music](https://study.unimelb.edu.au/find/courses/undergraduate/diploma-in-music/).

**Destination** | As a data scientist and musician, my lifetime pursuit is to **innovatively enliven human communication through an emotion-driven algorithmic composition system**. I aspire to enhance individuals’ ability to convey unspoken sentiments through music, thereby helping them overcome expressive limitations and alleviate mental anguish.

Therefore, my **research interests** broadly underlie the **intersection of high-level music technology and data science**, including but not limited to (sorted by preference)

-   algorithmic composition and orchestration based on machine learning
-   computational analysis and inference of human music perception and cognition
-   sound source separation
-   music information retrieval, MIR
-   cross-modal feature integration
-   similarity learning
-   automatic annotation
